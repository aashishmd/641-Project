\section{Important to Address}
\subsection{Graph Processing}
\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Many practical problems concern large graphs Eg: Web graph, Social Networks
  \item Popularity of Graph Algorithms for solving problems from various backgrounds
  \item Parallel computing resources has become a necessity to meet the computation  and memory demands
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Graph Mutation Operations}
\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Vertex-centric graphs can be solved in parallel fashion e.g. Page Ranks, Shortest-Paths
	\item Combination of Vertex-centric (parallel) and global (sequential) can't be solved in parallel fashion. Eg: k-means-like graph clustering algorithm
	\item Requirement of Graph Mutation operations
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
