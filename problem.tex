\section{Problem}
% TODO What is the problem and why do we care
\subsection{Context}
\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Pregel takes a directed graph as input where vertices and edges are associated with respective modifiable, user defined values
  \item Pregel has topology mutation to resolve conflicts
  \item Users need to have prior knowledge about ordering of mutation and conflicts that may occur
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Background}
\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
  \item More about Topology Mutation and Stuffs
  \item Conflicts presented in the paper
  \item Possibly an example
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
