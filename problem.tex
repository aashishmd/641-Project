\section{Problem}
% TODO What is the problem and why do we care

\subsection{Background}

\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Many problems in scientific computing, data mining and other domains are leading to graph algorithm specific soltuions
  \item Growth of these problems (e.g. Web Graph and various social networks) asks for parallel computing resources.
  \item Some of the algorithms requires a combination of vertex-centric (parallel) and global (sequential) computations. 
  	\begin{itemize}
	 \item An example could be k-means-like graph clustering algorithm.
	 \end{itemize}
  \item This type of algorithm requires a means of graph mutation operations.
    	\begin{itemize}
		\item Eg: Giraph, Mizan, GPS, Graph Lab (supports partial mutation)
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}	
\end{frame}

\subsection{Context}	

\begin{frame}
  	\begin{itemize}
		\item However, topology mutation operations performed concurrently at different vertices can conflict with each other
  \linebreak
  \item Pregel tries to resolve mutation conflicts by using:
  	  	\begin{itemize}
			\item Partial ordering
			\item User defined handlers
			\linebreak
		\end{itemize}
  \item Users need to have prior knowledge regarding ordering of mutation and conflicts that may occur
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Correctness partial ordering.
  \linebreak
  \item Design a detection technique to identify the all the conflicts that may occur while minimizing the false positives.
  \linebreak
  \item How to provide a better abstraction to enable means of an unambiguous mutation of graph topology?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
