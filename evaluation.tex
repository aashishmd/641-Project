\section{Evaluation Method}
\begin{frame}
Given a set of graph mutation, our goal is to prove:
  	\begin{itemize}
		 \item The reordering of edge remove $\rightarrow$ vertex remove $\rightarrow$
		 vertex add $\rightarrow$ edge add is equivalent to the original order
		 \item The soundness of our analysis to detect conflicting mutation
		 \item The completeness of resolving conflicting mutation with the
		 existence of required handlers.
	\end{itemize}
For the first goal, our mean is to model graphs and graph transformation in a
proof assistant to prove the equivalence of the reordering.
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item The same graph model can be extended to prove the completeness of the
	  2nd and 3rd solutions.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
 To evaluate the our anlaysis
\begin{itemize}
  \item We formalize the analysis to evaluate a sequence of mutation and return
  the existence of conflicts.
\item Formalize the semantic of newly defined mutation operations
\item Show that analysis reports true if conflicts exists
\item Show that conflicts doesn't exist with our proposed operations
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
