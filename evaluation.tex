\section{Evaluation Method}
\begin{frame}
Our two goals:
  	\begin{itemize}
		 \item The soundness of our analysis to detect conflicting mutation
		 \item The completeness of resolving conflicting mutation with the
		 existence of required handlers
    \end{itemize}
    Evaluating our solutions by applying it on graph processing platform
    benchmarks:
    \begin{itemize}
		 \item Graphalytics
		 \item Graph500
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
 We also plan to model graph transformations in proof assistants to
 provide a formal proof of the soundness of out solutions \linebreak
\begin{itemize}
  \item Formalizing graphs and graph transformation
  \item Formalizing our analysis
