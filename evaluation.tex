\section{Evaluation Method}
\begin{frame}
Given a set of graph mutation, our goal is to prove:
  	\begin{itemize}
		 \item The soundness of our analysis to detect conflicting mutation
		 \item The completeness of resolving conflicting mutation with the
		 existence of required handlers.
		 \item We want to model graph model graphs and graph transformation in a proof assistant and extend it further to prove the completeness of the 1st and 2nd solutions.
	          \end{itemize}	         
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
 To evaluate the our anlaysis\linebreak
\begin{itemize}
  \item We formalize the analysis to evaluate a sequence of mutation and return
  the existence of conflicts.
\item Formalize the semantic of newly defined mutation operations
\item Show that analysis reports true if conflicts exists
\item Show that conflicts doesn't exist with our proposed operations
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
